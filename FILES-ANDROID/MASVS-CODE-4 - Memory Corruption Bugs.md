## Overview

## Static Analysis

There are various items to look for:

- Are there native code parts? If so: check for the given issues in the general memory corruption section. Native code can easily be spotted given JNI-wrappers, .CPP/.H/.C files, NDK or other native frameworks.
- Is there Java code or Kotlin code? Look for Serialization/deserialization issues, such as described in [A brief history of Android deserialization vulnerabilities ↗](https://securitylab.github.com/research/android-deserialization-vulnerabilities "android deserialization").

Note that there can be Memory leaks in Java/Kotlin code as well. Look for various items, such as: BroadcastReceivers which are not unregistered, static references to `Activity` or `View` classes, Singleton classes that have references to `Context`, Inner Class references, Anonymous Class references, AsyncTask references, Handler references, Threading done wrong, TimerTask references.

## Dynamic Analysis

There are various steps to take:

- In case of native code: use Valgrind or Mempatrol to analyze the memory usage and memory calls made by the code.
- In case of Java/Kotlin code, try to recompile the app and use it with [Squares leak canary ↗](https://github.com/square/leakcanary "Leakcanary").
- Check with the [Memory Profiler from Android Studio ↗](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/memory-profiler "Memory profiler") for leakage.
- Check with the [Android Java Deserialization Vulnerability Tester ↗](https://github.com/modzero/modjoda "Android Java Deserialization Vulnerability Tester"), for serialization vulnerabilities.
