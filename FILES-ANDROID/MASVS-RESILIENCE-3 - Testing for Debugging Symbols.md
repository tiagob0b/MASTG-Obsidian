## Overview

## Static Analysis

Symbols are usually stripped during the build process, so you need the compiled bytecode and libraries to make sure that unnecessary metadata has been discarded.

First, find the `nm` binary in your Android NDK and export it (or create an alias).

`export NM = $ANDROID_NDK_DIR/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm`

To display debug symbols:

`$NM -a libfoo.so /tmp/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm: libfoo.so: no symbols`

To display dynamic symbols:

`$NM -D libfoo.so`

Alternatively, open the file in your favorite disassembler and check the symbol tables manually.

Dynamic symbols can be stripped via the `visibility` compiler flag. Adding this flag causes gcc to discard the function names while preserving the names of functions declared as `JNIEXPORT`.

Make sure that the following has been added to build.gradle:

`externalNativeBuild {     cmake {         cppFlags "-fvisibility=hidden"     } }`

## Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis should be used to verify debugging symbols.
