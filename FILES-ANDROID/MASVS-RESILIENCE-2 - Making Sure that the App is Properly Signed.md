## Overview

## Static Analysis

Make sure that the release build has been signed via both the v1 and v2 schemes for Android 7.0 (API level 24) and above and via all the three schemes for Android 9 (API level 28) and above, and that the code-signing certificate in the APK belongs to the developer.

APK signatures can be verified with the `apksigner` tool. It is located at `[SDK-Path]/build-tools/[version]`.

`$ apksigner verify --verbose Desktop/example.apk Verifies Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): true Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true Verified using v3 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v3): true Number of signers: 1`

The contents of the signing certificate can be examined with `jarsigner`. Note that the Common Name (CN) attribute is set to "Android Debug" in the debug certificate.

The output for an APK signed with a debug certificate is shown below:

`$ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs example.apk  sm     11116 Fri Nov 11 12:07:48 ICT 2016 AndroidManifest.xml        X.509, CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US       [certificate is valid from 3/24/16 9:18 AM to 8/10/43 9:18 AM]       [CertPath not validated: Path doesn\'t chain with any of the trust anchors] (...)`

Ignore the "CertPath not validated" error. This error occurs with Java SDK 7 and above. Instead of `jarsigner`, you can rely on the `apksigner` to verify the certificate chain.

The signing configuration can be managed through Android Studio or the `signingConfig` block in `build.gradle`. To activate both the v1 and v2 schemes, the following values must be set:

`v1SigningEnabled true v2SigningEnabled true`

Several best practices for [configuring the app for release ↗](https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html#publishing-configure "Best Practices for configuring an Android App for Release") are available in the official Android developer documentation.

Last but not least: make sure that the application is never deployed with your internal testing certificates.

## Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis should be used to verify the APK signature.
